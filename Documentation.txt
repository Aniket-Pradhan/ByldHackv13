Types Of Commands:

	*ASSIGN
		|
		--->Used to create or update variables

	*CREATE
		|
		--->Used to create blocks such as if, for adn while

	*FUNCTION
		|
		--->Used to call a function

Reserved words : assign , create , function , variable , if , else , while , for ,pass , done
Operations supported  : plus,minus,muliplication, division , modulus , power , and , or , not , all relational opertors

Guidelines : An instruction must follow certain rules to be valid and generate code appropriately
	*Must begin have assign , create , function as first reserved word
	*To refer to variable prefix the reserved word "variable" before its name
	*Prefix the word "with" prior to assigning an expression to a variable
	*Use the "done" reserved word to close a block

Examples:

	*Using the if-else construct
	|
	---> create an if statement where variable a greater than or equals five
		=> if a>=5 :
	---> create if variable a not equals variable b to the power variable c
		=> if a != b**c :
	---> create else
		=> else :

	*Using a while loop
	|
	---> create a while loop with variable a less than equal to variable d and variable c not equals three
		=>while a<=d and c!=3 :
	---> create a while loop with one 
		=>while 1 :

	*Using a for loop
	|
	---> create for loop of variable i from one to two
		=>for i in range(1,2) : 
	---> create for loop of variable i till one
		=>for in range(1):
	---> create a for loop with variable i from variable a to ten
		=>for i in range(a,10) :

	*Using the assign statement
	|
	--->assign the variable a  with variable c plus variable d raised to the power four plus seven
		=> a = c + d**4 +7

	*How to end a block 
	|
	--->done
